# Python - Hospitality Domain Analytics
 ## Problem Statement

Atliq Grants is a hotel chain which operates in many cities of India. They have different types of hotels such as Atliq Seasons, Atliq Exotica, Atliq Bay, Atliq Palace, and each hotel also has different types of rooms such as Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential. A person can book a hotel via different mediums such as Atliq Grants' own website and third-party websites such as Make Your Trip, Tripster, etc. The data of all the bookings goes into the bookings database of Atliq. Atliq Grants is facing a major challenge from their competitors. They are losing their revenue and market share. The main objective of this project is to create insights that helps them increase their revenue.

**My course of action:** &nbsp; Taking the role of the data analyst, I performed data analytics using Pandas on the Data Warehouse by pulling the data into JupyterÂ Notebook.
Performing the queries directly on the bookings database is not ideal as it is a mission-critical database and doing that may slow down the database. Instead, I performed the analytics by creating a replica or a copy of the original database. (Created database is called as Data Warehouse)

## Steps implemented 
  ### 1) Data Understanding:
  This phase involves getting familiar with the dataset we're working with. It includes understanding the structure of the data, the meaning 
  of each column or attribute, the data types, and any potential issues or limitations of the dataset.
  ### 2) Data Exploration:
  In this phase, we explore the data to uncover patterns, trends, or relationships within the dataset. This involves visualizing the 
  data using graphs, charts, or other visualization techniques to identify interesting insights or anomalies.
  ### 3) Data Cleaning:
  Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the dataset to ensure its accuracy 
  and reliability for analysis. This involves tasks such as removing duplicates, filling in missing values, correcting spelling errors, 
  standardizing formats, and handling outliers.
  ### 4) Data Transformation:
  Data transformation involves preparing the dataset for analysis by transforming or reshaping the data to make it suitable for the chosen 
  analytical techniques or models. This includes tasks such as aggregating or summarizing data, creating new variables or features and 
  normalizing
  ### 5) Insights Generation:
  The final phase of the data analytics process involves generating actionable insights or findings from the analyzed data. This includes 
  identifying key trends, patterns, or relationships in the data, making predictions or forecasts based on analytical models, and answering 
  specific business questions or objectives. Insights generated from data analytics can inform decision-making, drive business strategies, and 
  optimizeÂ performance.
