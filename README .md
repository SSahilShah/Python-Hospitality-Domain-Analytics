# Python - Hospitality Domain Analytics

## Project Overview
**Atliq Grants** is a hotel chain operating across various Indian cities with diverse properties, including **Atliq Seasons, Atliq Exotica, Atliq Bay,** and **Atliq Palace**. Each hotel offers different room types, such as **Standard, Elite, Premium,** and **Presidential.** Bookings can be made through Atliq Grants' website and third-party platforms like **MakeMyTrip** and **Tripster.** 

Facing competitive challenges, Atliq Grants is experiencing declines in revenue and market share. This project aims to deliver data-driven insights to support revenue growth and enhance market position.

## Project Scope

### Objective
The primary goal is to analyze booking data to uncover actionable insights that will help Atliq Grants improve revenue and retain its market share.

### Methodology
To ensure efficient analysis, I replicated the bookings database as a **Data Warehouse** and conducted the analysis using **Pandas** within Jupyter Notebook. Querying directly from the live database could impact performance, so this data warehouse serves as a non-disruptive replica for analysis.

## Process Steps

### 1. Data Understanding
   - Familiarized with the dataset, including its structure, column meanings, data types, and any potential issues.

### 2. Data Exploration
   - Explored and visualized data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies using graphs and charts.

### 3. Data Cleaning
   - Ensured data accuracy by addressing errors, inconsistencies, and missing values through tasks like removing duplicates, filling gaps, and standardizing formats.

### 4. Data Transformation
   - Prepared data for analysis by reshaping, summarizing, and creating new variables where necessary for further insights.

### 5. Insights Generation
   - Generated actionable insights by identifying trends, forecasting patterns, and addressing key business questions to support data-driven decision-making.
